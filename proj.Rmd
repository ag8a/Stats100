## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
data = read.csv('2022.csv')
data$Goals = as.double(data$Goals)
data$Assists = as.double(data$Assists)
data$Sh.90 = as.double(data$Sh.90)
data$G.Sh = as.double(data$G.Sh)
model1 = lm(data = data, Votes ~ Goals + Assists + Sh.90 + G.Sh-1)
model2 = lm(data = data, Votes ~ Tackle + Blocks + Interceptions + Clearances-1)
model3 = lm(data = data, Votes ~ Touches + Def.3rd + Mid.3rd + Att.3rd-1)
model1
model2
model3
plot(model3)
```



```{r}
?predict
new <- tibble(Goals=c(20.0), Assists=c(12.0), Sh.90=c(2.3), G.Sh=c(0.1))
tibs = data.frame(data[9,]) %>%
  select(Goals, Assists, Sh.90, G.Sh)
prediction = predict(object = model1, newdata = tibs)
prediction
```
